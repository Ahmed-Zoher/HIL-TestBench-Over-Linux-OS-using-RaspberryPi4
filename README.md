# HIL-TestBench-Over-Linux-OS-using-RaspberryPi4
Objective:

Implementing a hardware in the loop (HIL) platform to automate the testing of complex embedded applications. A test system is used to emulate the environment, inputs and outputs that the unit under test is expected to under-go during its operation, such emulation is realized through automated test cases or direct application of specified inputs.	

Modules:
-	A Raspberry Pi: The test system (Golden ECU).
-	A Communication Frame: An agreed upon format of the communicated message.
-	A GUI:  A user friendly GUI to facilitate the user entries to the system whether it is a test bench code or direct application.
-	A UDP server and client: Coordinates the communication between the PC application and the raspberry pi.
